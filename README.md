# Bob's Burgers WIKI

Description:

Ever since college, I have been a huge fan of Bob's Burgers. This American animated sitcom brings so much joy to their fans and I am beyond excited to have Bob's Burgers as my topic for my Phase 2 Project. 

The website features a list of all the characters and episodes in the show. Through the Navagation Bar, you will also find the "My Favorites" page where anyone can submit their favorite characters into the page.
